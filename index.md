# `til`

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Mainstream Renewable Power](https://www.mainstreamrp.com/) where I do web development & data engineering.

I'm written down here a few things I've picked up along the way (`Today I Learned` or `til`).  

As I learn something new I write about it in a `Markdown` file at https://github.com/rdmolony/til.  These files are automatically converted into `HTML/CSS/Javascript` by a static site generator called [`Emanote`](https://github.com/srid/emanote)

Specifically, I spend my time developing our internal data portal (`StationManager`) which we use to serve sensor measurement readings (wind speed, temperature etc) from sites all over the world.  This measurement data is used by our "Energy Analysis Group" to decide what renewables (wind or solar and/or energy storage) could be built & where they should go.  We use the [`Django` web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to serve this data from various databases, & for the time being, a mish-mash collection of `Python` tooling (`pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `pyodbc`) to fill the databases readings & explore them.
